    This solver is optimized for flow matching inference tasks, prioritizing
    speed and memory efficiency. It operates without building a computation
    graph and utilizes in-place operations where possible.

    The implementation is designed to be compatible with models that require
    additional conditional inputs, making it versatile for various generative
    modeling scenarios.

    The core of the solver implements the following steps for an ODE
    dy/dt = v(t, y) with a step size h:
        1. k1 = v(t, y)
        2. k2 = v(t + h/3, y + (h/3) * k1)
